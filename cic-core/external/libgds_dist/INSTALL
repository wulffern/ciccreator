           Look at libgds.c for more details on GDS format.
           Look at write_gds_examples.c obviously.

Simply type "make" to compile the library and the example program. 
Run the example program to create the file stuff.gds
then use your favorite CAD program to display the GDS file.

To install the library for general use, copy libgds.a to 
somewhere in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, such as /usr/local/lib
and copy libgds.h to somewhere like   /usr/local/include
